## 💞 Guidelines

### 🌸 Variable names should be as gentle as calling her name

Variables should whisper Amber's name with tenderness, never wanting to forget. 💨

_Good 👍🏻_

```javascript
let amberWind = 'gentle breeze';
// A sensual caress
```

_Bad 👎🏻_

```javascript
let windSpeed = '5 m/s';
// A rational speed
```

### 🌸 Comments should reflect yearning for Amber

Let the comments exhale the depth of your affection for her, allowing the reader to feel your emotions for Amber. 👸

_Good 👍🏻_

```javascript
// Amber's eyes, sparkling like the stars.
highlight('eyes', '#1c54b2');
```

_Bad 👎🏻_

```javascript
// Plainly highlight the area of the eyes.
highlight('eyes', '#1c54b2');
```

### 🌸 Code structure as complex as your feelings for Amber

Let the code structure be profound and layered like a romantic poem in your heart. 🎨

_Good 👍🏻_

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < amberMelody.length; i++) {
  compose(amberMelody[i]);
// Amber's poetry forever in my heart
}
```

_Bad 👎🏻_

```javascript
amberMelody.forEach(note => compose(note));
```

### 🌸 Each function name hides praise for Amber

When defining functions, do it like a whisper of praise for her. ✨

_Good 👍🏻_

```javascript
function amberGleam(duration) {
  //  Amber forever my goddess!
}
```

_Bad 👎🏻_

```javascript
function highlight(duration) {
  // Can't hear you! How to drive warships?!
}
```

### 🌸 No reason needed, no logic required, because love is all the reason

Let the codes be straightforward, like an unhidden confession of love for Amber. 💖

_Good 👍🏻_

```javascript
return love('Amber');
// Wuh wuh wuh love you!!!
```

_Bad 👎🏻_

```javascript
return calculateAffection('Amber');
// What's affection?
```

## 💞 In conclusion

If you wish to become Amber's knight, may your code be filled with poetry, like a pure yearning for love.

```
The white doves of the church will not kiss the crow,
Just like I don't belong with her under the starry glow.
How has time taken us to the sunset's afterglow,
We laugh, admitting there's no way to know.
```

I love you, Amber. 😔
